# Super Mario 64 Disassembler

This project is a **Super Mario 64 (SM64) disassembler** aimed at producing readable, buildable source code from the original Nintendo 64 ROM. The goal is to understand the engine at a low level, enable precise modifications, and support ROM hacking, research, and educational use.

The disassembly focuses on accuracy, matching the original game’s behavior down to the instruction level.

## Features

- Complete MIPS disassembly of the SM64 ROM  
- Matching builds with the original game binary  
- Labeled functions, variables, and memory structures  
- Clear separation between engine, behaviors, graphics, and audio  
- Designed for modding, research, and learning N64 development  
- Compatible with custom ASM injections and ROM hacks

## Project Goals

- Produce a clean, readable disassembly of SM64  
- Document internal engine systems (objects, rendering, behaviors, UI)  
- Make low-level modification and experimentation easier  
- Serve as a base for advanced ROM hacks and custom mechanics
