# Super Mario 64 Disassembler

This project is a **Super Mario 64 (SM64) disassembler** aimed at Converting Hex To ASM, View, Edit And Build SM64 assembly code, Geo layouts, Levelscripts and Behaviour Scripts
---

## Features

- Complete MIPS disassembly of the SM64 ROM  
- Labeled functions, variables, and memory structures  
- Clear separation between engine, behaviors, and scripts  
- Designed for Romhacking  
- Compatible with custom ASM injections and ROM hacks  

---

## Project Goals

- Produce a clean, readable disassembly of SM64  
- Document internal engine systems   
- Make low-level modification and experimentation easier  
- Serve as a base for advanced ROM hacks and custom mechanics
